Foodly Multivendor - Food Delivery App
Developed a multivendor food delivery platform using Flutter, Dart, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Firebase, with GetX and Flutter Hooks for state management. The app includes client, delivery, restaurant, and admin interfaces. Key features involve authentication with email/phone OTP, location-based restaurant recommendations, Stripe payment integration, Google Maps for adding multiple addresses, real-time order tracking, and dynamic home pages. It supports full cart management (CRUD), order customization, and rating of restaurants and food. This project highlights my ability to manage complex systems with multi-user roles while utilizing GetX and Flutter Hooks to ensure efficient state management and UI interaction.
